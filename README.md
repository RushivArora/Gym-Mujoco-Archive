## Gym Archive

Gym is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. Since its release, Gym's API has become the field standard for doing this.

Leading up to the release of Gym 1.0, the thrower and striker environments packaged as part of the Mujoco Physics simulated environments weere removed from Gym due to the low demand. Those two environments are archived here for users who might still be interested in using them or refering to the code.

This repository is purely an archive, and is not maintained.
